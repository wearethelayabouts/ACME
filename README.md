The Awesome Creative Media Engine is a CMS designed to help artists, designers, and producers create a cohesive and streamlined experience for both the end user and the creator. With extensive bbPress forum integration (and more boards to come), a flexible hierarchy/tag grouping system, and complete skinnability from totally site-wide all the way down to an individual piece of content, it makes it ideal for both serial and standalone works of written word, video, audio, still images (including a special comic mode), interactive media, or any combination you desire.
