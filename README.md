The Awesome Creative Media Engine is a CMS designed to help artists, designers, and producers create a cohesive and streamlined experience for both the end user and the creator, with a media-driven organization system, flexible APIs, support for news, static pages, scores, comments, and content advisory ratings. And CodeIgniter's separation of the logic from the presentation, PHP templates can be easily written without mucking about with function calls. ACME is ideal for creative studio showcases, artist collections, portfolios, and more, with support for written word, video, audio, still images (including a special comic mode), interactive media, or any combination you desire.
